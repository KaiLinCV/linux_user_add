# Add New Local User – Bash Script

This bash script automates the process of adding a new local user to a Linux system. I created it as a hands-on exercise to practice bash scripting and automate user account creation while following security best practices.

## 💻 Script Execution Flow

### 1. ❌ Non-admin attempt

Running the script without administrator privileges results in an error:

---

### 2. ✅ Running the script with `sudo`

The script accepts:
- First argument: desired username
- Remaining arguments: comment (e.g., full name)

```bash
sudo ./add_new_local_user.sh Jim "Jim Lee"
```

When access is granted, the script will do the following:

3. Displays the account credentials and hostname

## 🧪 Technique Used
Secure password generation using:
  - Current timestamp
  - sha256sum hashing
  - Special character insertion
  - Random shuffling with fold, head, tr

Conditional checks:
  - Script ensures it’s run as root
  - Verifies success after each critical step
  - Aborts immediately on failure to protect system integrity
